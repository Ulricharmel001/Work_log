# ALX Backend Engineering Program – June 2025 Work Log

Welcome to my monthly work log for **June 2025**, which marks my **second month** in the ALX Backend Software Engineering Program. This README summarizes what I worked on, my achievements, lessons from challenges, and key highlights.

---

## ⚙️ What I Worked On

This month covered **Week 4 to Week 7** of the program. I focused on:

- Understanding **control flow** in Python (`if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `match-case`)
- Learning **data structures**: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples
- Creating and using **functions** for reusable code
- Organizing code using **modules, packages, and libraries**
- Beginning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Practicing **error handling** to avoid program crashes
- Writing **unit tests** to verify code functionality
- Learning about **serialization and deserialization** for saving and loading data

---

## 🏆 Achievements

- Built Python scripts that respond to different inputs using control flow
- Gained strong understanding of **Python data structures** and used them in mini-projects
- Wrote custom functions for basic tasks like calculations
- Structured code using **modules and packages**
- Practiced **OOP principles**: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
- Learned to write **unit tests** using `unittest`
- Improved logical thinking and problem-solving skills

---

## 🔍 Lessons from Challenges

- Faced many **code errors**, especially when using unfamiliar modules and OOP—but learned by debugging and trying again
- OOP was tough at first, but practice and reviewing examples helped me understand better
- Balancing **university final exams** with ALX content was hard, but I overcame it with good time management and discipline

---

## 🌟 Highlights of the Month

- My first function worked perfectly after several errors—it felt rewarding!
- Watching my program make **decisions** was exciting—it felt like it could "think"
- Finished Week 7 with strong understanding of classes, objects, and testing
- Learned to stay consistent and focused even during stressful times
